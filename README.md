# GeoPy

This program demonstrates how to use the geocoding and reverse geocoding functionality available in Python's GeoPy package.  The latter of the functions used in the demo is get_distance(), which calls both get_latitude() and get_longitude() in order to calculate and return the distance (in miles).

## Applications of Geocoding
Uber, Lyft, Google Maps, Life360, and Waze utilize geocoding for a number of different purposes, including but not limited to ride-sharing, map directions, location-based services, etc..
