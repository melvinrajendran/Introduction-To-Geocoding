# GeoPy
## Activity Solution
This program is used to implement geocoding and reverse geocoding functionality using the GeoPy package in Python.  The latter of the functions used is the get_distance function, which calls both the get_latitude and get_longitude functions in order to calculate and return the distance (in miles).

## Applications of Geocoding
Uber, Lyft, Google Maps, Life360, and Waze utilize some form of geocoding for a number of different purposes, e.g. ride-sharing, map directions, location sharing, etc..
